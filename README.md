# AtlantaUnited_DataScientist_Project
This repository contains all the relevant contents used to complete the project for the Atlanta United Data Scientist job opening.

## Files
'ATL_DataScientist_Projects.R': The R script with all the written code for both projects. 
'ATL_MatchStats.csv': The data file for Project 1 with player match level stats from MLS.
'ATL_MatchSchedule.csv': The data file for Project 1 with metadata on MLS matches. 
'ATL_player_mins_apps.csv': The data file for Project 2 with information on minutes and matches played for players in the league.
'ATL_schedule.csv': The data file for Project 2 with metadata on the matches from the league. 
'ATL_eventdata.rds' file was too large to upload to Github. You can download it from this Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Xna8CVBMwhpf5xfAwVQTPVB8ZONfrC1?usp=sharing

## Instructions 
1. Open the R script in R studio.
2. Ensure the data files are in the working directory.
3. Ensure all the libraries are loaded in.
4. Note that both projects are in the same script. There are many comments making it clear when the code for Project 2 begins.
5. Run the script to reproduce the results. (Note: change player ID's for the Project 2 visualizations)

## About the Projects
In the first project I developed a model to predict the top 10 players in Major League Soccer (MLS) based on non-penalty expected goals (npxG) and open-play expected assists (xA) for the match weekend of March 22â€“23. 

In the second project I created player performance metrics from event data to identify attacking players with standout data profiles.
